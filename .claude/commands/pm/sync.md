# Sync

Full bidirectional sync between local and GitHub.

## Usage
```
/pm:sync [epic_name]
```

If epic_name provided, sync only that epic. Otherwise sync all.

## Instructions

### 0. Repository Protection Check

Follow `/rules/github-operations.md` to ensure we're not syncing to the CCPM template:

```bash
# Check if remote origin is the CCPM template repository
remote_url=$(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null || echo "")
if [[ "$remote_url" == *"zack744/CCPM-DIY"* ]] || [[ "$remote_url" == *"zack744/CCPM-DIY.git"* ]]; then
  echo "❌ ERROR: You're trying to sync with the CCPM DIY template repository!"
  echo ""
  echo "This repository (zack744/CCPM-DIY) is a template for others to use."
  echo "You should NOT sync issues or PRs here."
  echo ""
  echo "To fix this:"
  echo "1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account"
  echo "2. Update your remote origin:"
  echo "   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git"
  echo ""
  echo "Or if this is a new project:"
  echo "1. Create a new repository on GitHub"
  echo "2. Update your remote origin:"
  echo "   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git"
  echo ""
  echo "Current remote: $remote_url"
  exit 1
fi
```

### 1. Pull from GitHub

Get current state of all issues:
```bash
# Get all epic and task issues
gh issue list --label "epic" --limit 1000 --json number,title,state,body,labels,updatedAt
gh issue list --label "task" --limit 1000 --json number,title,state,body,labels,updatedAt
```

### 2. Update Local from GitHub

For each GitHub issue:
- Find corresponding local file by issue number
- Compare states:
  - If GitHub state newer (updatedAt > local updated), update local
  - If GitHub closed but local open, close local
  - If GitHub reopened but local closed, reopen local
- Update frontmatter to match GitHub state

### 3. Push Local to GitHub

For each local task/epic:
- If has GitHub URL but GitHub issue not found, it was deleted - mark local as archived
- If no GitHub URL, create new issue (like epic-sync)
- If local updated > GitHub updatedAt, push changes:
  ```bash
  gh issue edit {number} --body-file {local_file}
  ```

### 4. Handle Conflicts

If both changed (local and GitHub updated since last sync):
- Show both versions
- Ask user: "Local and GitHub both changed. Keep: (local/github/merge)?"
- Apply user's choice

### 5. Update Sync Timestamps

Update all synced files with last_sync timestamp.

### 6. Output

```

## Important Notes

Follow `/rules/github-operations.md` for GitHub commands.
